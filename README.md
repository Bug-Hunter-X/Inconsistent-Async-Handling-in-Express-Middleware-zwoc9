# Inconsistent Async Handling in Express Middleware

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in Express.js applications: inconsistent handling of asynchronous operations within middleware functions.  The bug can manifest as intermittent errors, unexpected behavior, or crashes.

## Bug Description

The provided `bug.js` file contains an Express.js application with middleware that doesn't properly handle asynchronous operations. This leads to race conditions and potential errors where responses are sent before asynchronous tasks are complete.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected code.  The solution uses `async/await` to ensure that asynchronous operations within middleware complete before proceeding to the next middleware or sending the response.  This provides a more robust and predictable application.
